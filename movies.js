    synopsis:   "No man can fight against time and in the end, \
                age will always take its toll. This seems to be the case when some \
                of the world's leading scientists and philosophers, all elderly men in \
                their seventh decade of life, start succumbing to Alzheimer's disease. \
                When it is discovered, that all of them used to be part of an abandoned \
                Cold War Project, Agent 0007 is sent to investigate. What he finds is a \
                conspiracy, a secretly funded UN laboratory and the Man with the Fool's touch."

    synopsis:   'The dragons - ancient and terrifying, have been gone for what seems like\
                an eternity, and indeed some have even started wondering, whether they ever\
                really existed. A furious storm levels down a peaceful hamlet and the few\
                survivors speak coldly of loved ones lost, forgotten fears revived... and a dark\
                shape hidden behind the clouds. Sandor, a young boy with little left, sets forth \
                looking for answers and once he finds them, he will have a dificult choice to \
                make. For he\'s not the only one searching in the Valley of Oblivion.'

    synopsis:   'The Megacity of New America (property of THEY-Inc.) is the last place on the planet, where you can \
                get an acceptable life. Citizenship is as desired as it is limited and entrance is \
                highly restricted. This has created a fertile ground for a few business \
                ventures such as ---Redacted by THEY-Inc.--- to engage in ruthless social engineering \
                experiments, that are archaically called "unethical".  Despite that, \
                access to New America is desired and a lone agent is eking out an existence as a \
                people smuggler. He is one day hired for an unconventional \
                task: Someone wants to LEAVE New America! ---THEY-Inc. would like to remind everyone \
                that attempts to leave are a breach of contract and subject to prosecution.---'

    synopsis:   '"There\'s GOLD in them there hills, son!" is what people used to say in the old world, \
                before omni-synthesizers and teleports made the resource based economy obsolete. \
                After the initial chaos, there was even more chaos as the world was desperately trying to \
                shake off its old habits. Now, a worrying discovery is made. A new Element \
                has been found in a nearby solar system, one that cannot be replicated by the omnis, and those \
                "old habits" of humanity are reappearing once more. The lust for power and riches in a society \
                that has had stable harmony for eons is bringing out heroes and villains alike and the future is \
                once again uncertain. The only thing certain is that there\'s Gold once again in them hills!'
